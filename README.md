# Villain Brand Ecommerce Capstone Project

This project was a way for me to get some hands on experience with HTML, CSS,, and Bootstrap.

Home Page: This is the first page a user would see when visiting the site. It includes a carousel that features images of notable villains, an ordered list containing simple steps towards starting down the road to "villainy", and two paragraphs of place holder text each paired with their own images.

Product Page: This page displays 6 products that are available for purchase. The page includes 6 cards from bootstrap to display the products that included their descriptions and included an add to cart button. 

Login Page: This is a log in page for returning users to re-order products or order new products more easily using saved information. This page uses a bootstrap login form page. It also includes an a link to the registration page in case a user does not already have an account.

Registration Page: This page is for new users wanting to sign up. This page utilizes the same bootstrap form as the last page with added check boxes to collect data on how this new user has found out about us. There are also two new input boxes for the user to confirm their email address and password.

Checkout Page: This is the checkout page for users wanting to checkout. It is a simple bootstrap checkout form. It also includes forms to submit you name, address and payments. It also displays the cart with a few hard-coded items and their prices.

Password Recovery Page: This page allows the user to get into their account if they've forgotten their password by sending a code to their email that let's them recover their password.

## Fun Addition
I think my favorite part of the site that you'd have to know about to really enjoy is what happens when you click the logo at the top of the screen. I think it's pretty fun.
